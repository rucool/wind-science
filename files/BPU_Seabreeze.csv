2021-07-13,,,N,149ft,KDIX,1605Z there seems to either be outflow from a system at 1503Z or it could be a sea breeze that developed on southern shores that moves towards DE bay?

2021-07-30,,,N,149ft,KDIX,I see something from 1927Z - 2205Z it might be a seabreeze that moves inland albeit north-east?
2021-07-31,12:01:00,23:59:00,Y,149ft,KDIX,I believe that in the early morning 12Z there is a sea breeze on the coast and it doesn’t start moving inland until later in the day?

2021-08-15,20:05:00,23:54:00,Y,149ft,KDIX,Very strong sea breeze (20 dbz) wondering if this is perhaps just precipitation being carried in the sea breeze?
2021-08-16,,,N,149ft,KDIX,"Not very sure if this constitutes as a sea breeze, less than 50% doubt so I will say no for now, subject to change."
